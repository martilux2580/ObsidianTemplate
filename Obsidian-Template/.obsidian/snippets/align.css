/*
CSS styling for centering stuff.

Obsidian does not support centering stuff natively because Markdown (.md files) donÂ´t support it. We need an HTML workaround.

In Obsidian, you can copy the following HTML code:
    <span class="center">![[Image1.png]]  <br> "Example1"</span>
and although Obsidian wont render it correctly, in the exported PDF the image Image1.png will be centered, as well as the text below "Example1" (not really a caption of the image but could be...).

This .css file should be placed in your Obsidian Vault folder in your file system, in a folder named snippets (if it isnt there, create it) inside the .obsidian folder. After that, reload Obsidian (not really needed but just in case....).

  .left {
